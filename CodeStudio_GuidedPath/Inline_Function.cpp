/*Disadvantages of using a normal function:

It uses time as it pauses some portion of code to complete
unless we are done with it; we canâ€™t move forward.
Creates a copy of variables each time while calling a
function.


To prevent this, what we can do is create inline 
functions. Inline functions replace the function 
call with its definition of when invoked.*/

//declaration of inline function
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

inline func()
{
       
}

int main()
{
    return 0;
